            Project Overview
          </Typography>
          <Typography paragraph>
            This project visualizes the relationships between Australian MPs and the entities mentioned in their 
            register of interests disclosures. It aims to make this important transparency data more accessible 
            and easier to understand for the public.
          </Typography>
          <Typography paragraph>
            The data comes from the Australian Parliament's publicly available register of members' interests,
            which contains information about MPs' financial interests, gifts, travel, and other potential
            conflicts of interest.
